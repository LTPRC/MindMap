# MindMap
The purpose of this project is to create a system where students can create and analyze mind maps online. This will allow both the development of an automatic feedback system reflecting student understanding as well as learning progress, and will allow researchers to collect a large amount of data on these mind maps. The system can be used in different disciplines for learners of different level. The system will allow students to graphically create a mind map that can then be analyzed with specially designed algorithms for checking studentsâ€™ understanding.
